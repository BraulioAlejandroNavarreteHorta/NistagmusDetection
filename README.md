# First Midterm Exam: Video Processing

This repository is dedicated to the video processing Jupyter Notebook for the first midterm exam. It includes a comprehensive analysis of the video provided in the `img` directory.

## Project Overview

The Jupyter Notebook `ProcesamientoExamen1P.ipynb` is an academic exercise aimed at applying video processing techniques to a specific video called `nistagmus.mp4`. This exercise is likely part of a larger series of tasks involving computer vision and digital image processing education.

## Contents

- `ProcesamientoExamen1P.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook with the image processing algorithm for the analysis of the video file.
- `img/`: This directory contains the video file used for processing:
  - `nistagmus.mp4`: A video file that is the subject of the processing task.
 
## Usage

The notebook is self-contained and includes all the required instructions and code to perform the ball tracking analysis. Follow the steps in the notebook for a guided experience.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you would like to improve the tracking algorithm or add new features, feel free to fork this repository and submit your pull request.
